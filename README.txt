Introduction
Hi! This is Arya Tyagi's Final Project. The Project is a version of the game Super Mario Bros. I chose this project because I grew up playing this game and I felt that making it or something like it was full circle. 

How to Run
To run the project first make sure the Quartus Project compiles. After Compiling, Run Configurations on Eclipse. After that the game should show up and once one of the players move scrolling starts. You can move the characters with WASD keys (MARIO) and arrow keys (Luigi). The game ends when you reach the castle snd the flag. You will know the game ended when the scrolling stops. You can jump on the Goombas and the platforms.

HAVE Fun!
